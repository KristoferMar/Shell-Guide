# Terminal shell commands
- We use commands in the terminal and a "Command" is a line that tells the terminal to perform an action. eg "date" gives you the current date.

- echo "hello" : Prints hello on the screen.
- say "hello there" : The computer says "hello there"

The 3 Rules of Commands are: 
1. A Command can act alone
2. A Command can act on something (act on string or something like that
3. A Command can have Options which let the command perform its action in a different way. (eg date -u : This gives you UTC)

Commands:
- Killall Skype : Kills a program completely. <br>
- cal: Gives you calender  <br>
    - cal 01 2010: Gives you calender from january 2010
